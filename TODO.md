- Generalize geometry from just 8-way grid to add 4-way grid (and in future, hex grid).
- Generalize strategy in some way to switch between BFS, Dijkstra's, A*, DFS.
- Set up a demo that switches between the possibilities, and a few different maps.
- Add more different terrain types than "clear" and "blocked". Mountains, roads?
- Fill rects instead of drawing squares for tiles, so it doesn't need to be so fast.
- Make the origin a distinct special case from Blocked so it doesn't look silly.
- Apply this somehow?
